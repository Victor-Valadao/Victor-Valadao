Hi, I’m Victor Valadao, a PostDoc at University of Turin.

I’m interested in Statistical Physiscs, Turbulence, Extreme Events, Computational Fluid Dynamics and others.

I have a terrible website in google.sites: https://sites.google.com/view/victorjvaladao where you can find more about me and my work.

If you want to get in touch send me an e-mail: victor.dejesusvaladao@unito.it or victorvaladao96@gmail.com.

I hope I can help you!
